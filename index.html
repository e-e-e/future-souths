<title>Future Souths: Aesthetics and Vocabularies of the Global Souths</title>
    <!-- Search Engine -->
    <meta name="description" content="Future Souths is a collaborative writing project comprising artists, curators, theorists and historians invested in contemporary analytics attuned to and entangled within the aesthetics of multiple located Souths. Through a series of dialogues, FS seeks to create a moving conceptual vocabulary of terms like ‘futures’ and ’souths’ and other inter-related and indirectly related ideas such as ‘networks’, ‘contracts’, ’contemporaneieties’, ‘specimisms’, ’global art’, ’transition’, and ‘crossings’. Collaborative dialogues allow new generative juxtapositions of thought to emerge as a means of both forming the FS vocabulary and making a contribution to the counter-archive of postcolonial and decolonial art historiography, theory, curatorship and aesthetics.
